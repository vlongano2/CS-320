#How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best way to ensure this is to test the program extensively. Testing will ensure the functionality. By doing this thoroughly, I can get a measure of the codes integrity as well as the program security.  

#How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The needs should be looked at in at least two different ways. What the user wants for an end result, and how the user wants to experience the program while aicheiving the end result. Incorporation involves taking on the mindset of potential users while also keeping the mindset of a software engineer to make sure what you are delivering is of the appropriate quality.

#How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by working backwards from the end result. I can then make lists of different componenents and map out how they all will work together. I will spend some timne studying the mapped out system to try to find any flaws in the higher level design before going into the lower level components and fleshing those out. I take an iterative approach to make sure I can constantly improve the system as I see fit.
